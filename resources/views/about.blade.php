    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>
        Marathon is among the few international marathons that are charitable: money received from participants for entry fee go to the charitable purposes.

        When we first started, there were only 3 people in the organizing committee of “Almaty Marathon”! Since then, the event has become larger, and our team has increased 6 times.

        Project managers, PR specialists, designers, operational managers, an accountant, a volunteer coordinator, a marketer, a driver, an office manager and, of course, a manager - together we are corporate fund «Courage to be first», which organizes the largest marathon in Central Asia and about 20 more sporting events per year.

        It is not only a marathon, a half marathon and races, the team also holds an annual cycling race “Tour of World Class Almaty”, the Swim, powerlifting, duathlon and triathlon competitions.
